  `chnl` Channel Layout Box

  This box may appear in an audio sample entry to document the assignment of channels in the audio stream.

  The channelcount field in the AudioSampleEntry must be correct; an AudioSampleEntryV1 is therefore required
  to signal values other than 2. The channel layout can be all or part of a standard layout (from an enumerated
  list), or a custom layout (which also allows a track to contribute part of an overall layout).

  A stream may contain channels, objects, neither, or both. A stream that is neither channel nor object structured
  can implicitly be rendered in a variety of ways.
