  `stss` Sample Size Box

  This box contains the sample count and a table giving the size in bytes of each sample.
  This allows the media data itself to be unframed. The total number of samples in the
  media is always indicated in the sample count.

  There are two variants of the sample size box. The first variant has a fixed size 32‚Äêbit
  field for representing the sample sizes; it permits defining a constant size for all samples
  in a track. The second variant permits smaller size fields, to save space when the sizes
  are varying but small. One of these boxes must be present; the first version is preferred
  for maximum compatibility.
      NOTE: A sample size of zero is not prohibited in general,
      but it must be valid and defined for the coding system,
      as defined by the sample entry, that the sample belongs to.
